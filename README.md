# Feature Flags API

A small, opinionated backend service built with **FastAPI** to manage and serve feature flags.

This project is intended as a **learning-focused, production-oriented** example of how to structure a Python backend using modern tools such as FastAPI, Pydantic, PostgreSQL, and Alembic.

The initial scope is intentionally minimal to keep the codebase understandable and extensible.
